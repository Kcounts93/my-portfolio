# My Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. I embarked on this project as a learning endeavor, keen to explore the capabilities of Tailwind CSS for the first time. The journey led me to fall in love with its utility-first approach and how it seamlessly integrates with React components.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this portfolio is to present a clean, minimal design that highlights my projects and skills, while also providing a deeper insight into my professional journey and personal interests. I've iterated through many versions to refine the design and user experience, ensuring that the focus remains on the content and its presentation.
